Problem Statement:

This is a Community App (fun based application) in which a person can see meme coming from the volley library and our users can make memes. This can be used when someone is not having a good day then one can freshen up their mind while using this.

Functionality and Concept used:

This is a simple meme sharing application. In this app we are making use of API calls using Android volley Library and how to process images using glide library. We are also using volley singleton pattern.

    • Constraint Layout: Most of the activities use a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
    • Buttons: Use of interactive buttons made it easier for the people to share and calling other meme on the screen.
    • Progress Bar Loader: Use of progress bar loader makes it more interactive and helps to style our app.
